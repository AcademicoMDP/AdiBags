AdiBags display the content bag in one view, gather into several sections using smart filters.

It is heavily inspired by Nargiddley's Baggins.

Configuration is available through Blizzard addon panel, /adibags chat command or right-clicking on the LDB plugin.

*Important note about localized filters*: some filters rely on translations from "LibBabble-Inventory-3.0":http://www.wowace.com/addons/libbabble-inventory-3-0/ so if some of them behave strangely in your locale, please take a look at the "library translation status":http://www.wowace.com/addons/libbabble-inventory-3-0/localization/.

* guild bank,
* alt bags and bank,
* bag skinning,
* complete in-game filter/section editor; though the built-in filters have some options.

h2. Tips & tricks

* you can create your own sections using the "manual filter" in filter configuration. You can then drag and drop items on section titles to reassign them ; this works for any section.
* if you want to highlight new items without putting them into a specific section, edit the "new items" filter priority to put it at the end of the filter list.
